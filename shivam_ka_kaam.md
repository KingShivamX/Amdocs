# Initial Setup & Structure
- We'll need to set up a React.js project with Tailwind CSS for styling
- The project should be organized with a clear component structure
- We should plan for routing using React Router
- Consider setting up Redux if we anticipate complex state management needs

# Key Frontend Components to Plan:
- Authentication pages (Login/Register)
- Assessment Test interface
- Dashboard
- Learning Plan display
- Progress tracking interface

# Critical Features to Consider:
- User authentication flow with JWT
- Interactive assessment test UI
- Visualization of learning clusters and recommendations
- Progress tracking visualizations
- Responsive design for various devices

# Component Priority Order:
- Authentication components (as they're needed first)
- Assessment test interface (second step in user flow)
- Dashboard layout and basic structure
- Learning plan display components
- Progress tracking features

# Technical Considerations:
- API integration planning for backend communication
- State management strategy (whether to use Redux or React Context)
- Form handling for the assessment test
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive design implementation

# UI/UX Focus Points:
- Clean, intuitive interface
- Clear navigation between sections
- Progress indicators for multi-step processes
- Engaging visualization of learning plans
- Accessible design patterns
